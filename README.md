# Localcoin
LocalCoin is a closed cycle token system designed to enable on-chain control and tracking of financial incentives in the real world. It is a product and service that manages the disbursement of funds which have restrictions on how they may be spent, comprising smart contracts on Soroban, a web app and mobile app, and eventually a payment card and seamless DAO integration.

The LocalCoin platform solves problems faced by philanthropic, or social good organizations regarding trust and transparency of how funds are used. The problems include:

* A lack of transparency for donors into how their donations are used.
* Donor resistance due to the lack of transparency, which limits trust.
* A risk of funds being misused if cash assistance is distributed.
* Possibility that unrestricted funds may quickly leave the community, like going to Amazon purchases, limiting their impact.

The LocalCoin platform addresses these problems by:

* Providing a closed loop system
* Providing a mobile dApp that can be used by both merchants and participants to exchange the local currency for the purchase of approved items.
* Enabling transactions with the local currency to be traced by recording them all on chain.
* Allowing definition of flexibly defined restrictions for how the local currency may be spent, with a list of approved merchants and approved items for purchase.
* Allowing for different issuances of currency to have different restrictions.
* Limiting transfers only to approved merchants will make trading outside the system infeasible.
* Merchants will be able to redeem the local currency for USD on demand.

The intended audience for the LocalCoin platform is:

* Local, social good DAOs - This seems like the ideal audience, for which LocalCoin can satisfy the need for fully on-chain governance and execution.
* Stand alone philanthropic organizations
* NGOs operating in developing countries


# Product
A local currency system built on the Stellar Soroban platform that creates tokens with custom
spending restrictions which can be issued by the campaign owner (backed by an equivalent
amount of stablecoin) and spent by the recipients with authorized merchants. Merchants can
finally exchange the tokens with the campaign owner for the local fiat currency thus completing
the loop.

# System Architecture
A simplified architecture will be built for the MVP, roughly shown in the diagram below.
